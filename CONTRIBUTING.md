# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, 

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this Project and its packages, which i hosted on my [Github Account](http://github.lucianojung.de/). 
Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Bugs

If you find any bugs of any kind feel free to note it. You can do this by...
- starting an issue
- sending an email to LucianoJ@posteo.de
- fixing the bug and creating a pull request for the repository

## Testing

I test the Program on myself, so it can happen, so i'm not supposing that there are no Bugs.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to this Project](https://github.com/lucianojung/SpaceInvadeUs/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done 
(read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). 
I can always use more test coverage. Please follow the common coding conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
Luciano Jung
